## Stack

We are developing the Website with *Node.js/Express.js* for Back-end, as it is easily scalable and has high performance and *Vue.js, Bootstrap* for the Font-end.

The Application development is planned using our **_[Project Board](https://github.com/pramod096/Featured-Location/projects/1)_** and our weekly progress is communicated through **_[Wiki](https://github.com/pramod096/Featured-Location/wiki)._**

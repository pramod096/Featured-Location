#### Website Development [***Proposal***](https://github.com/pramod096/Proposal-4B/blob/main/Proposal.md) for Featured Location [***RFP***](https://github.com/KeerthiMuli/featured-locations)

A Repo to develop a Progressive Web Application that looks good on any device. The application is a City Guide for Maryville, which offers users with essential city information and also saves time.


## Stack

We are developing the Website with ***Node.js/Express.js*** for Back-end, as it is easily scalable and has high performance and ***Vue.js, Bootstrap*** for the Font-end.

The Application development is planned using our ***[Project Board](https://github.com/pramod096/Featured-Location/projects/1)*** and our weekly progress is communicated through ***[Wiki](https://github.com/pramod096/Featured-Location/wiki).***

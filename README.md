#### Website Development [**_Proposal_**](https://github.com/pramod096/Proposal-4B/blob/main/Proposal.md) for Featured Location [**_RFP_**](https://github.com/KeerthiMuli/featured-locations)

A Repo to develop a Progressive Web Application that looks good on any device. The application is a City Guide for Maryville, which offers users with essential city information and also saves time.

## Stack

We are developing the Website with **_Node.js/Express.js_** for Back-end, as it is easily scalable and has high performance and **_Vue.js, Bootstrap_** for the Font-end.

The Application development is planned using our **_[Project Board](https://github.com/pramod096/Featured-Location/projects/1)_** and our weekly progress is communicated through **_[Wiki](https://github.com/pramod096/Featured-Location/wiki)._**

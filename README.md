## Stack

We are developing the Website with **Node.js/Express.js* for Back-end, as it is easily scalable and has high performance and *Vue.js*, *Bootstrap** for the Font-end.

The Application development is planned using our [**Project Board*](https://github.com/pramod096/Featured-Location/projects/1), [*Issues*](https://github.com/pramod096/Featured-Location/issues), [*Milestones*](https://github.com/pramod096/Featured-Location/milestones) and our weekly progress is communicated through [*Wiki**](https://github.com/pramod096/Featured-Location/wiki).
